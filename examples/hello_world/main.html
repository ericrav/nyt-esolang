        Nichelle Nichols, of the original Star Trek series, died last month. She was 89.

        When asked to define her role in the series, Ms. Nichols was modest, despite contributing to many cultural firsts such as the first televised inter-racial kiss, which was improvised with her co-star, William Shatner.

        “Women,” said Ms. Nichols, trailblazing actress, in a past interview. “Were not given much opportunity. We mostly innovated between the lines. Like the kiss. That's subversive.”
      </p>

        But Nichols' contributions were bolder than she let on. In 1977, Ms. Nichols began an association with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, contracting as a representative and speaker to help recruit female and minority candidates for spaceflight training; the following year's class of astronaut candidates was the first to include women and members of minority groups.

        “It's my duty. My mission. To help expand spaceflight and astronautics. To boldly move us forward,” said Ms. Nichols.
      </p>

        Because of this work, the actress had fans in surprising places, including Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who advised her not to quit the series at a time she was considering it. Ms. Nichols confirmed the story in prior interviews.

        “He told me to stay,” said Ms. Nichols. “Point blank. He said the movement needed me.”
      </p>

        “Entertainment relates directly to the world. We challenged reality,” said Ms. Nichols.
